## Quail

#### This Wiki is a work in progress, pages are missing, just like my eggs
We might eventually have some proper guides in here, but for now, you'll have to deal with this.

Bird-brained swerve drive utility.

To use quail, you need a few things. The first is swerve modules. I don't care where your swerve modules are. They could be 52 miles apart and in the shape of a pentagon and quail would still work.

The second thing you need is a little knowledge of Java. You should be able to:
- use a PID controller
- use subclasses
- make your motors spin

But, most importantly, you need a desire for freedom.
