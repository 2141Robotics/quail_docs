# Path - A Set of Points

## Class Summary
```java
path(ArrayList<double[]> points)
```
If you don't know what a path is, swerve might not be for you

## Usage
You make an ArrayList of points (double[]), and you give it to the class. It represents those. Have fun :D

Oh, you can cycle through the points using a few things, like `getCurrentPoint()`, `getNextPoint()`, and `getPointRelativeToCurrent()`.

We were nice and added some nearest point utils, `nearestPointIndex()` and `nearestPoint()`, pretty cool, huh?
